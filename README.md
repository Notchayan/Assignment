# Merchant Risk Analysis API

## Overview

The Merchant Risk Analysis API is a sophisticated system designed to evaluate merchant transactions and determine risk profiles based on a variety of predefined patterns. This API is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints. It leverages MongoDB for efficient data storage and Pydantic for data validation, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for merchant risk assessment.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Transaction Risk Analysis:** The API provides immediate risk assessment for transactions, allowing businesses to make informed decisions quickly.
- **Multiple Risk Pattern Detection:** It can detect various risk patterns such as velocity spikes, late-night trading, and split transactions, which are crucial for identifying fraudulent activities.
- **Customizable Risk Scoring System:** The risk scoring system is flexible and can be tailored to meet specific business needs, providing a personalized risk assessment.
- **RESTful API Endpoints:** The API is designed with RESTful principles, ensuring easy integration and interaction with other systems.
- **Asynchronous Data Processing:** Utilizing Python's asynchronous capabilities, the API can handle multiple requests efficiently, improving performance and scalability.
- **MongoDB Integration:** The API uses MongoDB for data storage, offering a scalable and flexible database solution that can handle large volumes of transaction data.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Models**
   - **Merchant Profiles:** Define the structure and attributes of merchant data.
   - **Transaction Records:** Capture details of each transaction processed by the system.
   - **Risk Patterns:** Represent the various risk patterns that the system can detect.
   - **Risk Profile Responses:** Provide a structured response format for risk assessments.

2. **Services**
   - **Risk Calculation Engine:** Analyzes transactions to calculate risk scores based on detected patterns.
   - **Transaction Processing:** Manages the processing and validation of transactions.
   - **Data Generation and Analysis:** Generates necessary data for risk analysis and performs in-depth analysis.

3. **API Endpoints**
   - **Merchant Management:** Endpoints for managing merchant data and retrieving merchant information.
   - **Risk Profile Retrieval:** Endpoints for obtaining risk profiles of merchants.
   - **Transaction Processing:** Endpoints for processing and analyzing transactions.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI, chosen for its speed, ease of use, and modern features.
- **Database:** MongoDB, selected for its scalability and flexibility in handling large datasets.
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic, used for its powerful data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI, providing interactive and comprehensive API documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Merchant Risk Analysis API, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: The API is built using Python, so a compatible version is required.
- **MongoDB**: The API uses MongoDB for data storage, so ensure it is installed and running.
- **pip**: Python's package installer, used to install the required dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the API

To start the API server, use the following command:
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```
This command will start the server with hot-reloading enabled, allowing you to see changes in real-time.

## API Documentation

The API comes with built-in documentation accessible via:

- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs` - An interactive interface for exploring the API endpoints.
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc` - A more detailed and visually appealing documentation interface.

### Main Endpoints

- **`GET /api/merchants/{merchant_id}/risk-profile`**: Retrieve the risk profile of a specific merchant.
- **`POST /api/transactions`**: Submit a new transaction for processing and risk assessment.
- **`GET /api/risks/{merchant_id}`**: Obtain a detailed risk analysis for a merchant.

## Security

The API incorporates several security measures to protect data and ensure safe operations:

- **Request Validation Middleware**: Ensures that incoming requests meet the required criteria before processing.
- **MongoDB Security Best Practices**: Follows recommended practices for securing MongoDB instances.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are in place to track and resolve issues efficiently.
